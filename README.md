Odin Recipe Project

This is the first project that TOP's 'Foundation' course wants me to complete. I will be creating a basic website that hosts recipes using HTML. It will be quite ugly for now but will later be re-styled using CSS. 

I hope to refresh my memory of HTML and CSS. Once I complete both of these segments this week I can move back into JavaScript and then refresh myself on python before moving to other languages mentioned to me.
